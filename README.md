Created a News app called NewsMoneky with the help of React.js and newsApi.
In this app the user can select the latest news based on category like Health,Science,Entertainment,Sports etc
The app have the feature of infinite scroll so the the user can keep scolling to all the news of that category with a loader feature which give a good experience.
The app also have the feature of red color loader at the top of the app which move smoothly from 0 to 100% like we have in you tube when the user switch from one category to another.
